This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


## Note: You have to have the following installed before the app can run locally.
- Node atleast version `v10.4.0`, Not sure for versions before this. Perhaps it might work, as I said, not sure.
- yarn, you'll use this to start the node server.
- npm atleast version `6.1.0`, not sure as well for verions before, but your can try your luck.
- 


- To run the application,
- Clone the repo,
- `cd Js-Shopping-Cart/my-app`,
- Run, `npm install`,
- Then, `yarn start`.
- Your app should then be running at `http://localhost:3000/`

- For more info about this, click the `my-app` folder in this repo and you'll see a more detailed README.
- Nice time :)
